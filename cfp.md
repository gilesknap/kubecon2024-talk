## Session Title

Running a Particle Accelerator Control System in Kubernetes

## Description (1000 character or less !!)

Diamond Light Source (DLS) is the UK’s national synchrotron, supporting over 14,000 researchers across fields like structural biology, energy, engineering, and environmental sciences. DLS generates intense beams of synchrotron light, enabling research in areas such as vaccine development and advanced materials.

To manage the thousands of devices in its accelerator and beamlines, DLS relies on EPICS, a widely used open-source framework for distributed control systems.

This talk will explore DLS’s journey in adopting Kubernetes, starting with data analysis and expanding to mission-critical EPICS systems. The transition faced challenges due to EPICS’ reliance on legacy network protocols, hardware integration, and a conservative community. The session will cover how these obstacles were overcome and highlight the benefits of Kubernetes, including continuous deployment, enhanced observability, better resource management, and improved reliability.
